                    <p>Schiff wants to lower inflation by addressing the scarcity that exists within the economy. This would be done through means of government intervention in the form of regulations and the passing of acts that provide more social benefits. 
                        Schiff does not believe in a blanket tariff as he states that this will lead to inflation. However, Schiff does believe in targeted tariffs against China, when they try to kill American corporations. (Do it strategically, but not indiscriminately). 
                        Schiff believes that our tax code is unfair to working people and middle income families. He wants to change that by eliminating the Trump tax cut. He would support child tax credits, and make the very wealthy pay their fair share.

He believes that by lower taxes and regulations the cost of living will lower. He believes in the elimination of regulations as it stifles the economy, which then limits growth. 
                        Free market capitalization supply side. 
                        Garvey believed that tariffs should be considered if the company overseas is a threat to a domestic company, but he does not believe that tariffs are the answer. Lower taxes is the key to not needing imports from foreign countries. 
                        Garvey believes that before the Biden administration, the tax was in the perfect spot. He wants taxation to allow small businesses to thrive. “I’m good with the Trump tax”, Garvey says, he thinks that it works and the Biden administration did a bad thing.

He wants a immigration policy that treats those who are immigrating as human beings, and provides relief for farmers. People who actually want to aid the US and actually make their living in the US should be treated with Respect and dignity. Schiff believes that a strong border and treating people as human beings does not have to be contradictory.

                        Dealing with the issue of fentanyl is first securing the border, dealing with Mexico honestly and straight forward, and dealing with China. Stop being nice with Mexico and China, people are being killed, Garvey says.

                        Schiff believes that it is unfair that people who rent cannot write off their rent like people with a mortgage on a house can, thus he wants to see a renters tax credit, so renters can get some help. Expanding section 8 vouture, which are originally intended for veterans.

                    <p>In the political ad titled Results by Adam Schiff, which focused mainly about his achievements during his time in the house of representatives. There is also a section in the ad that reflects his opinions on the former president Trump, where he says “he held a dangerous president accountable”. This ad does not directly attack his opponent Garvey, but still works towards attempting to get democrats from California to vote for him by showing them that he may protect California from Trump. 
                    Before the general election, Schiff posted an ad criticizing Garvey being too conservative. This ad was not meant as an ad to decrease Garvey’s chances, instead it was made to boost them. Due to the unique situation of California’s election laws, two candidates of the same party can move onto the general election. The point of the ad was to make sure conservatives in California vote for Garvey, so that Schiff will have an easier time in the general election against someone who is newer to politics. Additionally, Standing Strong PAC, a super PAC which supports Schiff spent over 9 million dollars in order to post a similar ad on FOX news.

The poll also shows that those who identify politically as progressive and pro-choice are more likely to vote for Schiff, while MAGA and strongly conservative voters are more likely to vote for Garvey.

            <p>I predict that the California Senate election will end in a victory for Adam Schiff both for finishing Dianne Feinstein’s term and for becoming the senator of California. Adam Schiff has an extremely positive record as a house member who passed legislation, which will look good to retrospective voters. In contrast Steve Garvey is a complete newcomer to the scene of politics, with no experience under his belt. In addition to his past experience Schiff has also spent and received more on his campaign than Steve did. Although, campaign finances does not dictate the result of the election, Schiff has spent more than double than his opponent, and was thus able to create more norterarity for himself. Even the polling data suggests that Schiff is more likely to take home the victory, with Schiff having around 50% of the votes and Garvey having 35%. All of the following is mentioned without mentioning the fact that California is an extremely blue state. Of all the senate elections in the past 10 years, the Democrats have managed to win all of them, with some elections having two Democratic candidates. 
                Their debate was also very telling of who will become the senator as during it Schiff gave answers that were different from each other, which made it seem he gave each answer thought; while Garvey had similar answers concerning similar topics: being the free market and limiting government regulations. Thus, Schiff is the more favored candidate in this race. 
                
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>Schiff supports Harris: he believes that Harris’ plan for the economy is solid and that she is a morally good human, who will be able to stand up to Putin. Schiff also states that he strongly dislikes Trump, as he believes Trump wants to be a dictator and that he uses the judicial department to threaten the US. 
                Garvey supports Trump as he believes that under the Trump administration, people were allowed to dream and that the US had a better economy. He publicly states that he has voted for Trump three times, but has not said that he is a “MAGA” republican. Thus, Trump has not yet endorsed Garvey.
